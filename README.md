# Chatbot ollama service

This service is a streamlit app that allows you to interact with open-source LLMs available on <https://ollama.ai/>.
This service is meant to be used in pair with the service [document vectorizer](https://github.com/swiss-ai-center/document-vectorizer-service).

First vectorize your documents with the document vectorizer service, then use the resulting vectors (stored in a zip file) to interact with the chatbot.
